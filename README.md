## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work enviroment.

- I built this app based on Figma designs.
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board.
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests.
  

## If I had more time I would change this

- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Refactor some of the code.
- I'd aim to elevate the user experience to a higher level.


## Technologies Used

- Next.js (13), Supabase, Stripe and Vercel


## Additional Info

- Along with each image is its original .psd (Photoshop) file
- Seed product data using the Supabase SQL editor from the seed.sql file (in this project)
- Use VSCode to instantly install the recommended extensions for this project (listed in the .vscode folder in this project)
