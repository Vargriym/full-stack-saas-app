## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work enviroment.

- I built this app based on Figma designs.
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board.
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests.


## Why I built the project this way

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple usestate is
sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymmore since GraphQL or
react-query are often used for data management.

- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the
frontend. That's why I decided to use Supabase rather to create a custom server. I have
basic backend knowledge as well.

  

## If I had more time I would change this

- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Refactor some of the code.
- I'd aim to elevate the user experience to a higher level.
