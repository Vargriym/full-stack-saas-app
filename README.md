# SaaS app with React

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work enviroment.

- I built this app based on Figma designs.
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board.
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests.
  

## If I had more time I would change this

- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Refactor some of the code.
- I'd aim to elevate the user experience to a higher level.


## Technologies Used

- Next.js (13), Supabase, Stripe, Vercel
